# Spotify Data Analysis and Case Study

In this repository, I perform data analysis on a Spotify Dataset. This dataset consists of ~600 songs that were in the top songs of the year from 2010 to 2019 (as measured by Billboard). You can explore interesting song data pulled from Spotify such as the beats per minute, amount of spoken words, loudness, and energy of every song.  

After some data analysis and visualization, there is a case study I solve and an extra Machine Learning model activity.
